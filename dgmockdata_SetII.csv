"No source of irrigation,  If source is there insufficiency of irrigation are the constraints. Depleting ground water tables is another concern. NGOs government should make farmers aware of  replenishing the groundwater. Farmers should aware of saving water. there are many technologies available in saving technologies. Another important thing in Irrigation is farmers should aware of critical periods of crop irrigation. Extension personnel should concentrate on making farmers understand the importance of critical periods of crop irrigation."
"We are facing a lack of irrigation facilities. From last 2, 3 years, we are not getting proper rainfall. There is no system for utilising existing water sources. Lot of manufacturing companies are nearby. They are using all this water. There is uncertainty in the water supply.
"
"soil is very polluted because there are lot of manufacturing companies nearby. farming is not productive with this polluted soil. These companies exiting lot of chemical compounds which is potentially dangerous to people. 

Also soils have been used for growing crops over years without caring much for replenishing. This has led to low productivity. The average yields of almost all the crops has reduced. This is a serious problem which can be solved by using more manures and fertilizers.

"government is taking care of government employees not of farmers. They want to kill farmer's and do industrialization. Farmers who produces base of Life, is been neglected by each and every government. Today farmers are leading a miserable life. sacrificing our lives to clear the crop loans. not able to feed our own families, while feeding other hungry mouths. much of the youth generation does not show any interest in farming any more. the old generation farmers are now looking for other source in income and does not want their next generation to do."
"Government should provide sufficient finance support to farmers. they should decrease the interest on farm loans. government projects should focus on their income. There are lot of current projects on the agriculture department. But in most of the cases, the result is not reaching into farmers.  Also, government should make sure about their profit and other subsidiary plans. This farmers insurance scheme is biggest robbery ever from farmers. "
We need modern farming techniques which are more productive. soil health can be revived by the application of existing scientific knowledge.Govt should focus on providing proper facilities for agriculture and train them to grow other crops which provide benefit to farmers. We should sell these crops to other countries for generating income.
"we are not getting proper treatment and there is no advanced facilities here. Better treatment requires money and farmers can't afford it. 
Farm workers have been found to be at increased risk for asthma and immunologic conditions. Most of the cases are due to reactions arising from grain-dust, fungal antigens, cereal pollens. Also facing lot of health issues due to chemical reactions from different pesticides. Most of the farmer families are not aware of their diseases and its treatment.

"
"In rural areas, the availability of hospitals and docters are very less. So people are not getting treatment when they need. In most of the time, medicines are not available in Government hospitals. If it is there also, it is selling for higher price. Government doctors are not ready to treat properly.  Treatments are costly for farmers here. so forced to take self treatment. Farmers are getting breathing issues, high asthma due to dust.
